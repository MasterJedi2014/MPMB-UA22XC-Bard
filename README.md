# MPMB-UA22XC-Bard
Adds the Bard class &amp; its subclass from "Unearthed Arcana 2022: Expert Classes" to the MPMB Character Sheets.

**Script Credit Note:**
A lot of the content of this script is either ripped directly from existing code or is an altered form of existing code. I have tried to diligently note when I copied code from elsewhere, but I probably missed some instances. A lack of note saying I ripped the code from elsewhere either means that I wrote that section of code entirely myself or that the code that was copied to use as a starting point was so heavily altered by me that almost nothing of the copied code exists.

**Script COntent Note:**
This Bard is the version that appeared in the UA22XC article. Due to the removal of the Arcane, Divine, &amp; Primal Spell Lists from playtesting, this Bard has been altered to adhere to the spellcasting rules of later articles. Some of the code references spells that appear in later UA articles. These spells will be added to the sheet by the scripts for those UA articles.

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.
